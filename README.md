## Challenges Faced

Implementing the MeetUp API was complicated and big challenge.
oAuth via Facebook and Github was difficult to implement.
Google Maps was really challenging to implement in the way we wanted it to be, especially compared to when we were using jQuery.

## Improvements and wishlist
A Google Map on the create post page to augment the autocomplete field- showing the location that the user has specified with a map pin.

Navigation between the user and the donor's location.

Rating system for the users to leave feedback on the donors.

Badges to encourage and reward sharing using Clowder.
